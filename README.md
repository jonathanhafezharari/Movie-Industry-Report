# Movie-Industry-Report
This study analyzed a dataset of over 10,000 movies to examine the factors that contribute to a movie's success in the international market. The study tested two hypotheses: the first hypothesis was that a movie's budget has no relationship with its revenue, while the alternative hypothesis was that movies with a higher budget tend to produce more revenue. The second hypothesis was that a movie's revenue depends mostly on its popularity, while the alternative hypothesis was that the popularity of a movie does not influence its revenue. The study found that both the budget and popularity of a movie were positively correlated with its revenue, as well as other factors such as the director, production company, and cast. These findings have practical implications for movie studios and production companies, as they can use this information to make informed decisions about their budgets, marketing efforts, and personnel for their movies. Overall, this study is important for our understanding of the factors that influence a movie's success in the international market and has practical implications for the movie industry.
